<h1 align="center">0Auth (ZeroAuth) - A Multi-platform zkLogin SDK Suite</h1>

0Auth is a multi-platform SDK suite for zkLogin. It is designed to be easy to use, and easy to integrate into your
existing projects. It offers a consistent native API across different platforms: use zkLogin with Objective-C on
iOS/macOS,
Kotlin/Java on Android, or C++/C on Windows and Linux.

The libraries meticulously adheres to the best practices delineated
in [RFC 8252Â - OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252), employing Custom Tabs for authorization
requests on Android and utilizing `SFAuthenticationSession` and `SFSafariViewController` for auth requests on iOS. To
maintain stringent usability and security standards, `WebView` on Android, along with `UIWebView` and `WKWebView` on
iOS, are explicitly unsupported, as elucidated
in [Section 8.12 of RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252#section-8.12).

# Introduction

Each SDK is fundamentally designed with three primary components to enhance functionality and security: an OAuth and
OpenID Connect client, a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) client, and a Salt client. These essential elements are readily
available across all platforms, offering you flexibility in managing your zkLogin flow. You can choose to delegate the
authentication process or navigate through the steps independently, with the assurance that the intricate backend
mechanisms are seamlessly handled for you. This structure not only ensures a robust security posture but also
streamlines the developer experience, allowing for efficient integration and interaction within various client
environments.

The zkLogin process is a concise, three-step sequence ensuring user privacy and security:

* **OAuth/OpenID Connect**: Handles user authorization and token exchange, verifying identity securely.

* **Salt Client**: Generates a unique 'salt,' anonymizing users to separate their identity from on-chain actions.

* **ZKP Client**: Receives the 'salt' and creates a cryptographic proof, authenticating users without exposing personal
  data.

# Features

* Multi-platform support
* Consistent API across platforms
* Easy to use
* Easy to integrate into existing projects

# Getting Started

## Kotlin Multiplatform

ZeroAuth is fundamentally a Kotlin multiplatform project. It's packaged as a unified entity but can branch out to
various platforms leveraging Kotlin's translation and interoperability features. Specifically, Kotlin JS can be
translated into standard JS, and Kotlin can produce native shared libraries compatible with languages that support
FFIs (Foreign Functions). This versatility ensures broad applicability across different platforms.

Add the following to your common `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("xyz.mcxross.zero:zero:<version>")
```

ZeroAuth provides artifacts for the following platforms:

* Android
* iOS
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* JVM

Here is a generic way to include it in your project:

```kotlin
implementation("xyz.mcxross.zero:zero-<platform>:<version>")
```

For example, to include the Android artifact:

```kotlin
implementation("xyz.mcxross.zero:zero-android:<version>")
```

Android libraries are flavored, the above example will include a release build. To otherwise include a debug build:

```kotlin
implementation("xyz.mcxross.zero:zero-android-debug:<version>")
```

# Usage

For how to use the library, please see the [documentation](https://zeroauth.dev) which provides a detailed guide on
how-tos and best practices.

# Contributing
