# zkLogin

zkLogin is an optionally **privacy-preserving** authentication protocol that allows users to send transaction requests to a blockchain
using traditional Web2 credentials. It does so by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs combined with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID.

It is developed and maintained by [Mysten Labs](https://mysten.io) and is currently supported by the Sui blockchain platform.

For more information about zkLogin, please visit [here](https://docs.sui.io/build/zk_login).
