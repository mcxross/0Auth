# Introduction

ZeroAuth is a cross-platform collection of robust open-source SDKs that allow developers to easily integrate zkLogin into
their (d)apps i.e. hybrid applications and dapps. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate, with a simple,
intuitive API that allows developers to quickly and easily add zkLogin to their hybrid applications and dapps.

Designed with security as a priority, it strictly adheres to RFC 8252 standards for native apps, employs
platform-specific authorization techniques, and avoids WebView methods to protect user data and guard against security
threats. Moreover, it assists clients in seamlessly complying with the security policies of various OpenID providers.
